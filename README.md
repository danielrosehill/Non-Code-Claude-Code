# Non-Code Claude Code

A small (and possibly not maintained!) collection demonstrating non-code uses of Claude Code.

## About

I believe that CLIs like Claude Code have applications that extend far beyond programming use cases. The purpose of this repo is to gather together a few examples of creative, non-traditional applications.
